compare_2018ULshaded_scaled.C is the plotting script to create charge profiles with a shaded are based on UL data.

ccp_templates.C creates the charge profiles

To produce the profiles below is a short example
Example:

root -b "ccp_templates.C(\"data2017_305406rereco\",
\"root://eoscms.cern.ch//eos/cms/store/group/dpg_tracker_pixel/comm_pixel/LATrees/2017/305406_EOY17_v2/LA\",1474)"

Where the first argument is the output directory where the output file
is going to be saved (and you need to create it before hand), 
the second argument is where the LA files are stored 
and 1474 is the number of files. 
Sometimes you need an extra argument “true” when the input files are ending with *_c.root
